This is my personal portfolio website — one of the very first projects I built when I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It’s a simple website made purely for practice and passion, and it marks the beginning of my journey into Frontend Web Development.

🚧 Note: This version of the portfolio is not updated and does not reflect my current skills, projects, or experience.
It’s a part of my early learning phase and will be redesigned and improved in the future.


🎯 Purpose
I created this portfolio to:

Apply what I was learning in real-world code

Build a small site that introduces me

Practice writing clean HTML, styling with CSS, and using basic JavaScript

Create a personal space I can improve later
